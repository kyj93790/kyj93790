# Hi, I'm Yejin Kim
I'm a M.S. student in Visual Representation Learning Lab at Sogang University, working under the guidance of [Prof. Junsuk Choe](https://sites.google.com/site/junsukchoe/).<br>
My research interests include *Computer Vision*, *Deep Learning*, *Explainable AI* and *Human Computer Interaction*.<br>

Currently, my research focuses on:
- **Long-tail Learning**
  -  Mitigating model bias that arises during the learning process from imbalanced data
 
- **Machine Unlearning**
  - Enabling models to effectively "unlearn" specific data to address issues related to user privacy, copyright, and data licensing
